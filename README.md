## Purpose

This repository is mainly an import of course work done in PROG2052, Integration Project,
for the purposes of showing off some of my work with TypeScript, Node.js, MongoDB and Neo4j.
In its current state the project runs with local mocks of external DBs only, as the 
original MongoDB and Neo4j DBs used to store user information and social graphs are no longer
running as of the completion of the course.
