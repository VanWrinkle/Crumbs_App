# Crumbs API

## Instructions

- React and Express (this API) are built as separate projects for now
- Before first deployment: Execute `npm install` in `client` and `server` directories to install all dependencies.
- Certificate `server.crt` and private key `private-key.pem` must be present in the root directory of the express
- Starting the API with `npm start` will also trigger a production build of the React project. 
- The service does not reflect changes to React. This service must either be restarted to trigger a new build or
by manually executing `npm start build` from the client directory.
