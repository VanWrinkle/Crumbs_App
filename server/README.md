# Crumbs API

## Instructions

- React and Express (this API) are built as separate projects for now.
- Prerequisites:
  - The files *server.crt* and *private-key.pem* must be present in the root directory of this service
  - One time only: Execute `npm install` in *client* and *server* directories to install the dependencies for both projects.
- Starting the API with `npm start` will also trigger a production build of the React project. 
- The service does not immediately reflect changes to React. This service must either be restarted to trigger a new build or
by manually executing `npm start build` from the client directory.
